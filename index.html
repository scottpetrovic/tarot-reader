      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Whispers of Fate</h1>

      <p class="direction-text">Greetings, seeker. I am Hector, keeper of arcane wisdom and interpreter of the tarot's mystic language. The cards whisper truths both profound and unsettling, revealing paths yet untrodden and choices yet unmade. But heed my warning: once unveiled, THIS KNOWLEDGE CANNOT BE UNLEARNED. It may challenge your perceptions and alter the very course of your life. Are you truly ready to peer beyond the veil and embrace the wisdom the tarot offers? The choice, dear seeker, is yours alone to make.</p>
