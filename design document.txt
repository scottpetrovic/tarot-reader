# Tarot Experience (sometimes called "cartomancy" )
# Tarot for self-care and mindfulness. Use with meditation

Have an interactive experience simulating a tarot reading experience.

- Using LLM model in results (maybe use ollama web server API??)
- give some training on the LLM being a tarot card reader to tell my fortune
-- need to make sure it knows about the upside down cards vs. right side up
-- give one result at a time and explain things
- Need way for me to manually select 7? cards to tell the fortune
-- maybe just have an array that stores all the items
- LLM reading results in and explain the card
- (DONE) possible to convert the text to audio (doing this with SpeechSynthesis API)




where to get Tarot information and images?
- possible to have fancy graphics or maybe 3d to enhance the experience.
- 3d graphics. maybe take Waite public domain cards and run through midjourney for alternate graphics
- images from wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot


how flow would work with experience
-----------------------------------
1. Ask the person if they want to learn about their future in relationships, or career?
2. Allow person to pick a card. UI would pull the card out and flip it around
3. Fortune teller would tell about the card in relation to what topic the person chose
4. Repeat step 2-4 through each step of the furtune telling
5. Give a summary at the end of the whole story
6. Do some fancy outro with smoke and the fortune teller disappearing like some mystical being


Card identifications with a fortune telling
-----------------------------
Card 1:  How you feel about yourself
Card 2:  What you want most right now
Card 3:   Your fears
Card 4:   What is going for you
Card 5:   What is going against you
