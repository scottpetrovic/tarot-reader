# Start Ollama web server locally

Need to install ollama from location (https://ollama.com/download)

If ollama is not running, you can manually run it with the following command in the command line:

    ollama serve

There is a default port that ollama web server runs on, so you shouldn't have to change anything on the web server


# Building things

to build the project run the following:
    npm run build
